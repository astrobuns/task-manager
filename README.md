## FAQ
1. What do the import/export buttons do?  
   This feature is intended for those who want to move their lists across different browsers or devices. The export button downloads a text file of your lists, while the import button uploads the file to the website.

2. Why have I stopped earning money for completing tasks?  
   To make the game mechanic a little more balanced, the maximum amount of money you can earn in a day is $100. Additionally, the maximum amount of money you can have is $10,000. I will add dialog boxes for these eventually!

3. Can I suggest a feature and/or report a bug?  
   Of course! You can send me an email at onlinetofu0@gmail.com.
